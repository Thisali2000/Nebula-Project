# SLT MOBITEL NEBULA Institute of Technology Student Management System

## Abstract
The primary objective of this project is to automate the existing manual Student Management System used at SLT MOBITEL NEBULA â€“ Institute of Technology. This automated system is designed to streamline administrative tasks, including student information management, course management, enrollment, registration, attendance monitoring, and more. The proposed system aims to eliminate the inefficiencies associated with manual processes, ensuring convenience and increased efficiency.

## Why do we need the Student Management System?
SLT MOBITEL NEBULA â€“ Institute of Technology currently faces challenges in efficiently managing various administrative responsibilities, especially those related to student data, attendance, and exams. The reliance on manual processes hampers the institution's operational efficiency, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. The existing paper-based system for managing student data lacks data security, is susceptible to data loss, and makes it challenging to track vital information. The proposed Student Management System addresses these issues by automating procedures, ensuring data integrity, improving communication, and providing an efficient platform for resource management.
